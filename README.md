**I develop high-performance voice applications that run in real time, handle heavy workloads, and maintain stable, low-latency performance even at global scale.**  

Many developers already rely on my open-source libraries (like [RealtimeSTT](https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeSTT), [RealtimeTTS](https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeTTS) and [Linguflex](https://github.com/KoljaB/Linguflex)) for accurate, responsive transcription and text-to-speech.

**My services include:**
- Setting up end-to-end real-time speech recognition and TTS pipelines for multi-user, low-latency environments.
- Implementing GPU optimization, load balancing, and runtime configuration for scaling under heavy traffic.
- Integrating various TTS engines (e.g. Coqui, StyleTTS2, Azure, ElevenLabs, ... ) and fine-tuning them for quality and speed.
- Applying sophisticated audio chunking, compression, and sentence logic to improve transcription accuracy and responsiveness.
- Enabling real-time streaming via browser-based clients with stable, continuous, and natural-sounding output.
- Integrating voice activity detection (VAD), wake-word recognition, and other advanced speech features.
- Incorporating large language models to support streaming tool-calling, contextual responses, and dynamic memory or RAG workflows.
- Offering reliable backend infrastructure advice, including containerization and orchestration (e.g. Modal, Runpod, Kubernetes) for global-scale operations.
- Providing guidance on tuning parameters to ensure optimal audio quality, stable performance, and minimal latency.
- Advising on training data and model selection to achieve fast, robust, and context-aware results in speech and language tasks.
